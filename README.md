# 📊 Online News Popularity Prediction

This repository contains my Master's project on predicting the popularity of online news articles using machine learning algorithms.

## 📝 Project Description
This project aims to predict the popularity of online news articles by using three machine learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Feature selection techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and F-Score were used to select the most relevant features.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Online News Popularity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/newspopularity/data)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍 (for coding and implementation)
- Scikit-learn 📦 (for machine learning models)
- Google Colab 📓 (for training and evaluation)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)

## 📁 Project Files
- `Online_News_Popularity.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the project code
- `data/`: Dataset used for training and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## ▶️ Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-news-popularity-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the `Online_News_Popularity.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement real-time prediction updates as user trends change.
- Focus on ethical AI practices to prevent misinformation.
